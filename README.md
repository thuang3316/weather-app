You can type in the name of the city in the search bar and get basic weather information at the moment.

The icon left to the search bar can be toggled to change the temperature metric between fahrenheit and celsius.

The background gif comes from [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/), which should pretty much demonstrate the current weather. (Some of them are kind of fun. Try it out!)

The weather info comes from [visual crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/).
